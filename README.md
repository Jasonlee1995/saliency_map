# Saliency Map Implementation with Pytorch
- Unofficial implementation of the paper `Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps`


## 1. Implementation Details
- `1. Class Model Visualisation.ipynb` : update zero image using pre-trained model with target class
- `2. Image-Specific Class Saliency Visualisation.ipynb` : make saliency map of an image using pre-trained model with target class


## 2. Reference
